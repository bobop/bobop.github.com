I am privileged to sit on the Steering Committee for DataGM, the Greater Manchester Datastore for open data. I am on the committee as the developer community representative since I'm a freelance Web Developer and have created some [Open](http://traffordopendata.heroku.com/) [Data](http://traffordcounciltax.heroku.com/)sites previously.

Yesterday afternoon the site was launched to an audience of representatives from the 10 Councils Authorities, Greater Manchester Police, the NHS, GMPTE and others. Here is the site:

And here are my notes from the launch:

**Welcome and Introductions** 
_ Matt Colledge, Leader, Trafford Council_

After introducing the speakers and welcoming the DataGM steering group, Matt Colledge quoted Peter Drucker as saying "The temptation of business is to feed yesterday and starve tomorrow" making the point that Open Data feeds tomorrow. He then went on to give some examples including the ability to find your nearest GP on your iPhone or look for nurseries or rate care homes.

He pointed out that Open Data can drive perfomeance and service efficiencies and mentioned a Nottinghamshire persanalised prescriptions service. He pointed out that up to 600 staff in Greater Manchester are looking for data in the public sector alone.

He ended quoting Elaine Dundon who said that "good innovation provides an environment where sacred traditions are challenged."

**The Transparency Agenda and the London Datastore** 
_ Emer Coleman, Director of Digital Projects, Greater London Authority_

Emer's presentation went through 3 lessons we should learn from the London Datastore journey.

Lesson 1: It's not about data. Opening data is about changing organisational culture from closed to open. Many organisations have fears opening their data such as "what if its wrong", and "what if they want different decisions from us"

She then compared the state as rational, technical and ordered and people as human, open and adaptive pointing out that Open Data collides these worlds together. Data release begins with conversations rather than control.

Lesson 2: The State won't do this on its own. The environment needed for data to be opened requires the State, Digital disruptors and the Media. At GovCamp 2011, 200 "Goverati" people attended to engage with government. We need to stop thinking it's "them and us", and instead believe it's "us and us."

Lesson 3: Are we there yet? The development of ideas such as Open Data are not linear, rather they are emergent and unpredictable. The return on investment (ROI) from Open Data is not quite measurable yet because it is in its infancy and projects like the Public Data Corporation are being contested.

**Introducing DataGM** 
_ Theresa Grant, Deputy Chief Executive, Trafford Council_

Theresa talked about how Trafford Council started small and grew the amount of data sets they opened. She pointed out that Eric Pickles wants all information available to the public for their own interpretations and that Trafford Council released their &gt; &pound;500 supplier spend ahead of the requirement date.

With the help of Future Everything they have managed to achieve their open data releases within the last year. Their current data is strong and getting stronger and they beleive that they should be the custodians of data rather than the controllers.

She pointed out that people make connections that Authorities don't and that sharing and understanding their data will help authorities.

**Opening Greater Manchester Transport Data** 
_ David Hytch, Information Systems Director, GMPTE_

David Hytch started his presentation listing some stats form GMPTE: They manage 14,000+ bus stops, 200+ train stations, 300,000,000 journeys per year, 40+ bus operators, 2,000+ bus routes and more.

He is convinced that Open Data &amp; Open Source should go hand in hand due to the closed nature of propriatery systems. He, and GMPTE, are interested in open data because of cost savings, better quality, higher reliability, increased flexibility, and the benefits of open vs proprietary systems. They have already identified over 150 datasets in GMPTE and are still looking.

David suggested some barriers to opening their data are Ordnance Survey derived data, Traveline's code of conduct, data quality / integrity, and their aging internal systems. Some issues he highlighted include the longevity of third party products, charging for access to data, and the policing of third party use of their data.

GMPTE are creating an informed personal traveller which will relay realtime information as you travel on iphone &amp; android devices. It will track you on your journey and alert you to traffic, roadworks, etc.

**Opening Greater Manchester Crime Data and GMP Tweets** 
_ Kevin Hoy, Web Manager, Greater Manchester Police_

Kevin explained that GMP had used social media for 3 years and had moved from publishing to engaging.

He went on to talk about their Twitter Day (GMP24). Usually they would have gathered data and issued press release, but they decided to use twitter instead for real-time results. The logistical issues included having just over 1 week to prepare, they didn&rsquo;t want to censor anything and had to cover 24 hours using 3 shifts. They were careful about formatting the tweets by numbering them and using hashtags. They made the feed available from the GMP homepage &amp; their intranet, and used office staff not frontline staff to reduce criticism over the resources they used.

Because there were so many tweets they were generating, they reached the limits of Twitters acceptable use, so they had to create extra accounts. They did talk to Twitter HQ in advance by Twitter said they couldn't help with the limits issue. Their main twitter account had 3,000 followers at the start of day which they had accumulated over 2 years, and at the end of day they had 19,000 followers, many wanting to converse through twitter! They alse uploaded video's and photo's throughout the day top YouTube and Flickr.

GMP now provide information at the local level through localised twitter accounts and  intend to share their information with hyperlocal sites.

**Discussion and questions** 
_ All_

Rufus Polock spoke about the Public Sector Transparency Board which includes Tim Bernes-Lee.

A question was raised about the longevity of DataGM, the consensus reached was that the more its used, the more self sustaining it will be.

Emer was asked about whether there was a tipping point for the London Datastore. She suggested that Transport &amp; Crime data had the biggest public interest.

Emer was also asked about the health data in the London Datastore. She said the NHS was very supportive, and that health data may become more useful with more crime data.

She was also asked about the impact on Freedom of Information requests which the London Datastore had. She suggested they get about the same volume, that Open Data is a different form of engagement, and FOI's are often politicized.

**Closing remarks** 
_ Janet Callender, Chief Executive, Trafford Council_

Janet was thankful that the meeting didn't go into too much technical detail. She said that lessons can be learned from Emer's journey, mainly that we shouldn't constrain the benefits of Open Data to what we can think of today. She pointed out that the Open Data debate surfaces the machinery of government and makes it more relevant, debunking it's mystery and that this will engage citizens, the next step being new solutions.

She pointed out that we have to be prepared to accept failure along the way and that Open Data is not just about data, it's all about innovation. We're at the beginning of the journey, no-one has the monopoly of wisdom.

As David pointed out, it is commecialy astute to open data and GMP showed true innovation in their Twitter Day. Janet finished by encouraging us to create the conditions where data is curated and not controlled.
