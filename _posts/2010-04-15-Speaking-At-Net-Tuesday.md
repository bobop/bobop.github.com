title: Speaking At Net Tuesday

I'll be speaking at [Net Tuesday this month](http://www.meetup.com/The-Manchester-NetSquared-Meetup-Group/calendar/12760850/) about the Web &amp; Social Media Consultancy which I have recently secured funding to provide.

The Consultancy is available for free only to organisations or people in the third sector - charities, community groups, individual campaigners, etc.

I'll be sharing the plan to provide consultancy and help to 48 organisations or people over the coming year - an ambitious goal! I hope to be able to help them understand and use technology and online services more effectively and efficiently. I also hope to recieve some advice and recommendations on how to implement this Consultancy and what else I could advise or offer to these third sector groups and individuals.

So if you want to find out more, come along to **Net Tuesday on the 27th April at 6:30pm at [MadLab](http://madlab.org.uk)**, 36-40 Edge Street, Manchester, M4 1HN.

If you're in the third sector and are based in Greater Manchester and would like some free Web &amp; Social Media Consultancy, just email me at [ben@bobop.co.uk](mailto:ben@bobop.co.uk) and I'd be glad to help!
