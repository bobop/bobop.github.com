Ordnance Survey, the company behind the great maps you find in tourist information centres or village newsagents, have opened up their map data to the public under the name [OpenData](http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/).

This is a big deal for the Open Data movement in the UK, many supporters have been pushing for this for many years. I have been interested in Open Data for a while now because it is right that we citizens have access to the data our government, and others, collect about us and the areas we live in. I joined the brand new [Open Data Manchester](http://opendatamanchester.wordpress.com/) group in the hope that I might be able to help develop some really useful applications using the data which the Greater Manchester Authorities might open up over the coming months.

Will this new service from Ordnance Survey replace Google Maps on UK based websites? I think it will be dependant on the API - how much developers can do with these maps. One thing in it's favour is that many non-techie web users might feel more comfortable with the style of these maps from the Great Britain Road Maps in their cars, or the OS maps they've bought when going for walks.
