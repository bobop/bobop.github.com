Last night's [Social Media Surgery](http://socialmediamanchester.ning.com/group/socialmediasurgery) was another great opportunity for people to find out more about social media and how it can help them or their organisation attract attention or spread their news. I was one of the surgeons again along side [Adrian Slatcher](http://twitter.com/adrianslatcher), [Karl Brookes](http://twitter.com/nhssalford), [Mark Hanson](http://twitter.com/markhanson), [Jennifer O-Grady](http://twitter.com/Jenniferogrady) and the organiser [Chi-chi](http://twitter.com/realfreshtv).

Topics included the optimal frequency of Tweeting, the Times' paywall, the future of Ning and how best to Blog for Business. Like last month, I really enjoyed the opportunity to share some thoughts and offer advice to the attendees about their social media related issues.

I'm chuffed to have been offered a permanent place as a surgeon at Manchesters Social Media Surgery. Chi-chi offered me the role due to my social media consultancy work in the third-sector and I'm excited about the idea of being able to help many other people and organisations during these surgeries over the coming months.
