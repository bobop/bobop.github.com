title: Working with Chris "Open Data" Taggart
---

At the recent [Future Everything](http://futureeverything.org/) festival in Manchester I managed to grab a quick conversation with Chris Taggart of [OpenlyLocal](http://openlylocal.com/) fame.

I had known for some time that he had been inspired to build OpenlyLocal by a half built concept I had suggested and help build a few years ago at some informal&nbsp;[TYOC](http://tyoc.co.uk/) hack days in Manchester. I was working on a project with Skateboarders in Manchester City Center and had become frustrated at the lack of transparency in the local Council. Inspired by [TheyWorkForYou](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/), I wondered if a similar ManchesterCityCouncilWorkForYou site could be developed and we began building it at the TYOC hackdays.

MCCWorkForYou never got finished, but Chris took the idea and built OpenlyLocal which has changed local politics around the UK by making the councils more transparent. In our brief conversation I mentioned I was a Ruby on Rails developer and asked whether I could use my experience to help build and develop [OpenlyLocal](http://openlylocal.com/), [OpenCharities](http://opencharities.org/) and/or [OpenCorporates](http://opencorporates.com/) further. Having built a few local apps from local Opened Data, I was wanting to get involved in some larger scale Open Data projects. Chris was keen on me being involved so we agreed to talk about it after I got back from my&nbsp;imminent&nbsp;holiday.

Since then, we've conversed by email and I will be taking a look at optimising and adding features to the OpenCharities website. I'm looking forward to getting my teeth into a bigger Open Data project!

**UPDATE:** For various reasons including time commitments on my side, I ended up not working with Chris on OpenCharities, much as I would have loved to :(
