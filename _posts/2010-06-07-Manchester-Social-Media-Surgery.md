Although "Social Media Surgery" suggests some kind of life-saving operation performed on some social media site, it's actually a place to come and get help or find out more about social media and how it can benefit you or your organisation:

> Social Media Surgery events are informal, free-to-attend, evening business networking events based around a panel made up of social media practitioners and agencies discussing&amp;dissecting social media project issues presented by the attending crowd.

I will be one of the "surgeons" at this months session, held at the [MDDA](http://www.manchesterdda.com/) (Lower Ground Floor, 117-119 Portland Street, Manchester M1 6ED) tomorrow evening (8th June) from 5:30pm. This months theme is "LinkedIn vs Facebook for Business: Pros and Cons" though you can come and raise any social media related issues. See the [Ning site](http://socialmediamanchester.ning.com/group/socialmediasurgery) for more details.

It will be the first time I will have been to a Social Media Surgery so I don't really know what format to expect but I hope to be able to help some people out!
