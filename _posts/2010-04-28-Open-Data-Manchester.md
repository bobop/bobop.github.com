I managed to get the the end of the first [Open Data Manchester](http://opendatamanchester.wordpress.com/) meeting on tuesday evening organised by [Paul Robinson](http://vagueware.com/) through his work with [Future Everything](http://www.futureeverything.org/news/opendata1). I'm excited about this group and what may emerge from it, especially after meeting some of the other folk who are interested too.

What pleased me most was that there were people at the meeting who represent each stage on the journey open data will take to become useful to the public. Specifically I met a journalist and a digital producer. I thought it would only be developers at the meeting but with the developers building tools to use the open data, digital producers helping to translate that into accessible forms and journalists feeding the results to the public, it seems that the right mix of people and skills are involved with this new Open Data Manchester group. Which is really exciting!

Once the first set(s) of data become available, I can't wait to see how, and how quickly, the tools and visualisations emerge.

I was greatly inspired and encouraged by Tim Berners-Lee's brief talk at TED earlier this year. Take a look:
