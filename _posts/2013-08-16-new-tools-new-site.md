title: New Tools, New Site
---

Well, I've gone and redesigned and rebuilt this website! 

I was wanting to optimise the site so that potential clients would find it easier to contact me and be better pursuaded that I will add value to their project. So I added a section about my [Experience](http://bobop.co.uk/#experience) with Ruby and Rails, and some great [Testimonials](http://bobop.co.uk/#testimonials) from recent clients.

I took the opportunity to build the site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a tool I hadn't had the opportunity to play with. I've found Jekyll to be ideal for a simple site like this, with a handful of pages and a basic Blog feature, and I can host the site free with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)! I've also chosen to use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for these Blog posts so they would be easier and quicker to write.

I wanted to have a go with a different front-end framework havinf used [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) before. So I went with [Gumby](http://gumbyframework.com/) which I've enjoyed using. I liked the flat design elements and of course it is responsive so the site will look good on small and large screens.

I also recently dabbled with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) on a simple [one page site](http://www.communityobedience.com/). I had tried to use Sinatra a few years ago with the [OpenCharities](http://opencharities.org/) site, but for whatever reason it wouldn't work properly locally and the frustration made me abandon my efforts, so I'm glad I've started to understand it better.
