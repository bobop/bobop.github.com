title: My Trafford Trees Map In The Manchester Evening News!
---

Manchester Evening News have published an article about the Trees map I created using Trafford's Open Data!

[See the article here](http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1324892_log_on_for_interactive_guide_to_the_leafy_suburbs)! [See the Tree map here](http://traffordopendata.heroku.com/trees).

I am glad that the article highlighted Open Data well and I hope it encouraged and pressures Trafford Council to open more data, and the other Greater Manchester Councils to open their data quicker!
