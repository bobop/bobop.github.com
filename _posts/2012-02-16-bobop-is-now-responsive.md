title: Bobop is now Responsive!
---

This website is now responsive to different screen sizes using the [Responsive Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design) technique.

I used [Twitter's Bootstrap tool](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) to create the layout and design of this site a few months age. Since then, Bootstrap has upgraded to version 2.0 which includes Responsive Design features. I've spent this evening upgrading Bootstrap and making sure it looks right at different screen resolutions as you can see:

**Huge Screen (large monitors):**

**Large Screen (laptops &amp; monitors):**

**Medium Screen (tablets):**
