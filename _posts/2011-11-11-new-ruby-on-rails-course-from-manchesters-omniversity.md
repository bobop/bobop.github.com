title: New Ruby on Rails Course from Manchester's Omniversity
---

When I started learning Ruby on Rails while working for [Liquid Bronze](http://www.liquidbronze.com/) back in 2005, it was a pretty steep learning curve. And with all the changes to [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) since, you have to be able to continually learn and change your practices (mainly for the better!).

So a course such as this one from the [Omniversity of Manchester](http://omniversity.madlab.org.uk/) would have been immensly helpful, and will be immensly helpful for anybody wanting to learn Ruby on Rails. On top of that, it is being run by my friend and RoR + Javascript expert [Ric Roberts](http://ricroberts.com/pages/about).

Here's more information aboput the course:

This is a 3 day "bootstrap" course aimed at giving you the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to build and deploy your very own Rails applications from scratch. It will cover the most recent versions of Ruby (1.9.2) and Rails (3.1). You will learn:

*   the basics of the Ruby language
*   how to build a Rails application from scratch using Rails best practices
*   how to manage your database with migrations
*   how to build complex models using ActiveRecord, including associations, validations and callbacks
*   how to enhance your UI using Rails' built-in support for unobtrusive JavaScript and AJAX
*   how to quickly add functionality and extend your Rails applications using third-party plugins and gem libraries
*   all about REST and how following RESTful conventions leads to code that is easier to develop and simpler to follow
*   about TDD (Test Driven Development) and how Rails helps you quickly and easily write tests to validate your applications behaviour
*   the options and best practices for automated deployment for quick, headache-free deployment and updating of your apps
