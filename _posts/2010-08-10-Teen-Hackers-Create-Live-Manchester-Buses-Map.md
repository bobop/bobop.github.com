title: Teen Hackers Create Live Manchester Buses Map

Last week the Manchester Young Rewired State team were in MadLab hacking together some fun, interesting and brilliant sites.

I spent half an hour with them on Tuesday hearing about the ideas they had and what they had coded so far. I was really impressed by their creativity, enthusiasm and intelligence and some of their ideas ended up winning awards at the presentation ceremony in London on the Friday.

My favourite 2 apps are the mobile optimised Bus Timetable web app and the Live Bus Map showing where buses are across Greater Manchester (if they are on time!).

Both of these apps use the GMPTE Bus timetable, route and service data which was is the first release of this kind of data in the UK. Paul and Julian from the Open Data Manchester group negotiated the release of this data and announced it less than 2 weeks ago. When I heard about this data being made open, a live map of buses was the first thing I imagined it could be used for, like the live London underground map I saw a couple of months ago. So to see it built within 2 weeks of the data being released is really exciting!

I have a few thoughts on how this data might be useful in other ways, but more on that another time.
