title: BootstrapClub & Successful Products

I helped form the very informal [Bootstrap Club](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bootstrap-club) a few months ago for people wanting to discuss and share ideas around bootstrapping their ideas and businesses.

My interest in seeing such a group form was that I was developing [Glidely](../projects/7-Glidely) and [GiftAidr](../projects/9-GiftAidr) and was learning about the [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) methodology of starting successful businesses off one's ideas.

The BootStrap Club meets monthly at [Common](http://www.aplacecalledcommon.co.uk/) in Manchester's Northern Quarter and consists of casual discussion about one anothers projects and ideas. I've learned plenty of fascinating information and ideas from these discussions and have been helpfully challenged about my assuptions and approaches to my ideas.

At the last meeting, [Tekin](http://tekin.co.uk/) mentioned [Amy Hoy](http://unicornfree.com/)'s [30x500 idea](http://unicornfree.com/30x500/). It suggests that there is no need to aim for 1million customers when all you really need is around 500 customers paying $30 monthly for a comfortable income - which makes sense to me.

I read quite a bit on her blog yesterday and went through some of the free sessions she's made available. It certainly a different approach to the Lean Startup, suggesting that you don't need that initial "great" idea, rather you need to research pain points of niches and work out what solution will be valuable enough to gain paying customers. Of course there is much more to it, but I think that's a fair summary and what I read excited me again.

I met with some people who run and help Charities yesterday to see what their pain points are. There are many in the Third Sector, such as funding, and attracting quality volunteers. But I think I may have discovered a pain which if solved correctly could attract a few hundred paying customers. Watch this space!
