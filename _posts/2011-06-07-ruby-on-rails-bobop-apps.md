title: Ruby on Rails Bobop Apps

In the last few months my confidence to quickly build apps has increased, initially through the Open Data apps I built, then the launch of Glidely was another boost. Of course, quickly building apps shouldn't mean they are badly built, and I have been Lean and Agile as much as I can be - it's true that you are your own worst client!

Here are 3 of the most recent non-client apps I've built:

### GiftAidr [http://giftaidr.com ](http://giftaidr.com/)

I created GiftAidr.com to scratch my own back. I had stopped GiftAiding my donations to charities because of the hassle of tracking my donations for my tax return. "If only there was a simple mobile app I could use on the go where I could quickly record my GiftAid donations as I make them!" I thought. So I built it!

### Glidely** **[http://glidely.com](http://glidely.com/)

Glidely.com has been an idea in my head for 2 years, and I finally decided to do something about it. It imports your tweets and maps them on an interactive timeline. It will soon import your Facebook updates, Flickr photo's and RSS feeds too. Why not [give it a whirl](http://glidely.com)?!

### GMBuses** **[http://gmbuses.heroku.com](http://gmbuses.heroku.com/)

I began this at a Lovely Data Hack day as a way of making the Bus timetables in Greater Manchester more accessible than they are from the Transport for Greater Manchester website where they are only available in PDF's. I then added pretty maps and will soon create a mobile optimised version.
