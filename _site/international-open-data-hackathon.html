    <p>I've been to the <a href="http://opendatamanchester.org.uk/">Open Data Manchester</a> event for the <a href="http://www.opendataday.org/">International Open Data Hackathon</a> today and it's been very interesting and productive.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bobob_prod/images/medium/9/OpenDataHackathon-logo.png?1322929757" title="International Open Data Hackathon" alt="Opendatahackathon-logo" /></p>

<p>The event was held at <a href="http://madlab.org.uk/">MadLab</a> and gathered a fair few people interested in making something or playing around with Open Data. For the event <a href="http://www.tfgm.com/">Transport for Greater Manchester</a> gave us some sample Bus Fare data to take a look at. Unfortunately it was in PDF's and convoluted spreadsheets so extracting it would be a big pain. Also, the names of the Timing Point stops were not referenced to any outside information so it would be a hefty manual job to connect them to the Naptan stops.</p>

<p>Peter Stoner from <a href="http://traveline.info/">Traveline</a> came along and it was very interesting talking to him about how Traveline do the Journey Planning and about NextBuses which is a Traveline mobile inteface for finding the time of your next bus.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bobob_prod/images/medium/10/jquery-logo.png?1322929827" title="jQuery Mobile" alt="Jquery-logo" /></p>

<p>I spent most of the afternoon adding <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> to my <a href="http://gmbustimes.com/">Greater Manchester Bus Times</a> app, so it now has a mobile interface which should make it easier and faster to find the time of the next bus when you're standing at the bus stop. The next step will be to grab your geo coordinates to locate the stop you're at and make finding the bus times even quicker.</p>
