  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last year or so I have learned how hard it is to build a business out of an online product or service. I've learned this through the experiences of friends, co-workers and groups such as the <a href="http://bootstrapbusinessclub.co.uk/">Business Bootstrap Club</a>.</p>

<p>So a couple of months ago I decided that instead of waiting until I had the financial flexibility and time to invest in creating a bootstrapped business, I should instead consider the ideas I have for web apps as side projects. This way there is little pressure for the product to grow big, or even succeed, and I can enjoy the development process in my own limited time.</p>

<p>So I created Borrow Note: <a href="http://www.borrownote.com">http://www.borrownote.com</a></p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bobob_prod/images/medium/16/Screen_Shot_2013-03-05_at_16.23.57.png?1362500673" title="Borrow Note" alt="Screen_shot_2013-03-05_at_16.23.57" /></p>

<p>The idea came from the fact that my wife and I forget who we've lent stuff too, and we borrow things quite reguilarly from friends and family. To be reminded who borrowed what and to see if any friends have a drill, for example, which I could borrow would be very useful, and I thought such a tool might be useful to others.</p>

<p>Seeing Borrow Note as a side project means I can experiment with different Ruby Gems, Heroku Add-ons and coding techniques, which I've really enjoyed. So I've used <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> as the visual framework instead of Twitter's Bootstrap which I've used previously. I also wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic">Formtastic</a> instead of <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form">Simple Form</a>, but I discovered Simple Form integrates much better with Foundation, especiallly with the inline errors which Rails produces when form data is not valid. I had heard of a <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/markerb">Markerb</a>, a gem which uses a single Mardown file to create both the HTML and Text multiparts of an email, so I've used that to see how good it is.</p>

<p>I decided to create a very basic reminder service, then get some feedback before I add further features. The feedback I've had has confirmed my thoughts on allowing users to create accounts to track multiple items, with additional features, such as specifying a particular date for the reminder email to be sent, and to see what friends on the site have available to borrow.</p>

<p>Starting Borrow Note has certainly satisfied my desire to create and experiment, and has provided an alternative to watching nonsense in my evenings!</p>
