    <p>When I started learning Ruby on Rails while working for <a href="http://www.liquidbronze.com/">Liquid Bronze</a> back in 2005, it was a pretty steep learning curve. And with all the changes to <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> since, you have to be able to continually learn and change your practices (mainly for the better!).</p>

<p>So a course such as this one from the <a href="http://omniversity.madlab.org.uk/">Omniversity of Manchester</a> would have been immensly helpful, and will be immensly helpful for anybody wanting to learn Ruby on Rails. On top of that, it is being run by my friend and RoR + Javascript expert <a href="http://ricroberts.com/pages/about">Ric Roberts</a>.</p>

<p>Here's more information aboput the course:</p>

<p>This is a 3 day "bootstrap" course aimed at giving you the skills, knowledge and experience necessary to build and deploy your very own Rails applications from scratch. It will cover the most recent versions of Ruby (1.9.2) and Rails (3.1). You will learn:</p>
