      <p>At the recent <a href="http://futureeverything.org/">Future Everything</a> festival in Manchester I managed to grab a quick conversation with Chris Taggart of <a href="http://openlylocal.com/">OpenlyLocal</a> fame.</p>

<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/bobob_prod/images/medium/3/branding.png?1322174356" title="Future Everything" alt="Branding" /></p>

<p>I had known for some time that he had been inspired to build OpenlyLocal by a half built concept I had suggested and help build a few years ago at some informal&nbsp;<a href="http://tyoc.co.uk/">TYOC</a> hack days in Manchester. I was working on a project with Skateboarders in Manchester City Center and had become frustrated at the lack of transparency in the local Council. Inspired by <a href="http://www.theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>, I wondered if a similar ManchesterCityCouncilWorkForYou site could be developed and we began building it at the TYOC hackdays.</p>

<p>MCCWorkForYou never got finished, but Chris took the idea and built OpenlyLocal which has changed local politics around the UK by making the councils more transparent. In our brief conversation I mentioned I was a Ruby on Rails developer and asked whether I could use my experience to help build and develop <a href="http://openlylocal.com/">OpenlyLocal</a>, <a href="http://opencharities.org/">OpenCharities</a> and/or <a href="http://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a> further. Having built a few local apps from local Opened Data, I was wanting to get involved in some larger scale Open Data projects. Chris was keen on me being involved so we agreed to talk about it after I got back from my&nbsp;imminent&nbsp;holiday.</p>

<p>Since then, we've conversed by email and I will be taking a look at optimising and adding features to the OpenCharities website. I'm looking forward to getting my teeth into a bigger Open Data project!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> For various reasons including time commitments on my side, I ended up not working with Chris on OpenCharities, much as I would have loved to :(</p>
