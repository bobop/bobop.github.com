<p>I'll be speaking at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Manchester-NetSquared-Meetup-Group/calendar/12760850/">Net Tuesday this month</a> about the Web &amp; Social Media Consultancy which I have recently secured funding to provide.</p>

<p>The Consultancy is available for free only to organisations or people in the third sector - charities, community groups, individual campaigners, etc.</p>

<p>I'll be sharing the plan to provide consultancy and help to 48 organisations or people over the coming year - an ambitious goal! I hope to be able to help them understand and use technology and online services more effectively and efficiently. I also hope to recieve some advice and recommendations on how to implement this Consultancy and what else I could advise or offer to these third sector groups and individuals.</p>

<p>So if you want to find out more, come along to <strong>Net Tuesday on the 27th April at 6:30pm at <a href="http://madlab.org.uk">MadLab</a></strong>, 36-40 Edge Street, Manchester, M4 1HN.</p>

<p>If you're in the third sector and are based in Greater Manchester and would like some free Web &amp; Social Media Consultancy, just email me at <a href="mailto:ben@bobop.co.uk">ben@bobop.co.uk</a> and I'd be glad to help!</p>
