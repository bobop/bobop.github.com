<p>Yesterday morning I met with the <a href="http://www.trafford.gov.uk/opendata/">Trafford Council Open Data</a>team in their office in Sale. I wanted to find out how the 3 apps I have built off their Open Data could be made more useful, and happily obliged me with the meeting! I met with Phil Welch and Jeremy Page who are part of the GIS team, and Victoria Moody, the Principal Scrutiny and Improvement Officer at Trafford Council.</p>

<p>It was great to talk directly with the suppliers of this Open Data and to hear about the way they collect the geographic data from across departments. We discussed some data I thought would be interesting such as contaminated land, planning permissions, road closures and road works. I was excited to see that they were determined to open as much of their data as they could and suggested that these datasets would be opened as soon as they can do so.</p>

<p>One of the exciting outcomes of the meeting was the agreement from the team to make sure their data related to the same area groupings. I explained the problem with the current data they have published is that, for example, the Trees data groups them in "districts" such as Altrincham or Bowden, and the Parks data groups them in "locations" which don't include Bowden but have other names. This means that you can't cross-reference&nbsp;the trees and parks in the same area because the areas are determined differently.</p>

<p>During the meeting, the team agreed that it would be useful to group all their geographic data by Super Output Areas and political Wards, as well as including other&nbsp;geographic&nbsp;groupings which government uses. This would be a vaulable addition to the data and will result in some interesting comparisons of facilities in different Trafford areas.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the meeting and felt very encouraged in the <a href="http://traffordopendata.heroku.com/">work</a> <a href="http://traffordspending.heroku.com/">I've</a> <a href="http://traffordcounciltax.heroku.com/">done</a> using their Open Data, and impressed and excited at the approach and attitude to getting as much data open as they can. Well done Trafford!</p>
